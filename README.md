 __HashFinancial__ is a, proof of concept, financial analysis python application which was a freshman year project for __CS102: Data Structures__ course. It aims at a comparative analysis of several companies listed on NASDAQ through their ticker values. Linear Regression seemed a likely statistical method for prediction given our current scope of exposure to Machine Learning.
